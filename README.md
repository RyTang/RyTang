# Hi

Hi, welcome to my Github Collection. Within this collection are all the projects or current hobbies/interest that I find interesting and worth sharing. Feel free to browse through all of them. Each project is neatly divided up into their own divisions, maybe you're interested in seeing what I did in university or maybe you're interested in what I'm doing in my spare time. Each project will have a general description of what's happening, and hopefully an in-depth explanation of each thing.

I hope you enjoy browsing through my Collection.
